 | THE LOST KEMO |			
	---------------
  IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE  CORNFIELDS, KEMO LIVES WITH HIS
PARENTS AND SIBLINGS IN A BIG HOLE THAT EXTENDS UNDERGROUND.
KEMO LOVES TO PLAY A LOT IN THE CORNFIELDS AND THE FOREST.

ONE DAY HE ASKED HIS MOM TO GO OUTSIDE TO PLAY IN THE CORNFIELDS.
HIS MOM AGREES ON THE CONDITION THAT HE RETURNED BEFORE THE SUN SET.
SO HE WENT OUT HAPPILY, THEN HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND
SAID : I AM GOING TO WALK A LITTLE BIT IN THE FOREST AND THEN GO BACK
HOME BEFORE DARK COMES.

HE ENTERED THE FOREST AND STARTED MOVING AROUND THE TREES, THEN HE FOUND
ON THE GROUND A BIG WALNUT.HE WAS PLAYING WITH IT WITH HIS FEET UNTIL
HE ENTERED THE HEART OF THE FOREST.

KEMO STOPPED SUDDENLY IN HIS PLACE AND RECOGNIZED THAT THE SUN HAD GONE DOWN
AND THE DARK STARTED.HE REMEMBERED HIS MOM'S
WORDS THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE LATE AND RETURNED HOME.
AT THAT TIME, HE TURNED AND STARTED RUNNING IN THE FOREST.

HE RAN FOR TOO LONG BUT HE DIDN’T REACH TO THE CORNFIELDS
WHERE HE LIVES, SO HE STAYED IN THE FOREST BETWEEN THE TREES.
HE TURNED TO THE RIGHT SIDE AND STARTED RUNNING AND RUNNING
UNTIL THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT INCREASED AND HE GOT EXHAUSTED.

KEMO STARTED CRYING. HE WAS SCARED OF GETTING EATEN BY ONE OF
THE FOXES, SO HE DECIDED TO HIDE IN THE NEAREST HOLE HE REACHED,
SO HE WALKED A FEW STEPS AND HE FOUND A SMALL HOLE AND ENTERED
IT AND SLEPT BESIDE A SMALL ANIMAL.

THE SUN ROSE AND ALL THE ANIMALS GOT UP.
INCLUDING THE RABBIT'S FAMILY THAT LIVES IN THE HOLE  WHERE KEMO ENTERED.

THE RABBIT'S MOM WAS SURPRISED. SHE HAS 3 CHILDREN. WHO IS THAT ANIMAL
SLEEPING BESIDE THEM? THE RABBITS WERE SURPRISED.
THEIR FUR IS WHITE BUT HIS IS PURPLE, THE RABBITS' EARS ARE BIG BUT HIS IS SMALL.

THE RABBIT'S FATHER CAME WITH SOME CARROTS AND SAW THE SMALL PURPLE ANIMAL BETWEEN
HIS CHILDREN, SO HE SAID: LOOKS LIKE HE HAD LOST HIS WAY HOME IN THE DARK,
SO HE ENTERED OUR HOME AND SLEPT WITH US.

THE RABBIT'S FATHER AND KEMO WENT TO A BIG TREE WHERE THE OWL LIVES.
THE RABBIT'S FATHER SAID TO THE OWL : GOOD MORNING OWL, I HAVE A PROBLEM.
COULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME SOLVE IT?

THE OWL SAID:GO AHEAD RABBIT.
THE RABBIT : LAST NIGHT THIS SMALL ANIMAL CAME TO US AND WE DIDN’T KNOW
WHERE HIS HOME WAS, SO WE COULD RETURN HIM TO IT.
THE OWL : DON’T WORRY RABBIT.I WILL LOOK FOR HIS HOME
AND FAMILY.WAIT FOR ME HERE.I WILL COME BACK SOON.

THE OWL FLEW ABOVE THE FIELDS THAT ARE NEAR THE FOREST
AND HE EXAMINED IT WITH A KEEN EYE, BUT HE GOT CONFUSED BECAUSE OF
THE NUMBER OF HOLES IN THE FOREST. THEN HE RECOGNIZED FROM FARAWAY
A GROUP OF PURPLE ANIMALS THAT HAD GATHERED IN ONE PLACE.
HE WENT TO THEM AND ASKED THEM ABOUT THE CAUSE OF THE GATHERING.
THEY TOLD HIM THAT ONE OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS GOT LOST IN THE FOREST.
THE OWL KNEW THAT THEY WERE KEMO’S FAMILY AND HE BROUGHT KEMO BACK
TO HIS FAMILY . FINALLY, KEMO CAME BACK HOME.

WHEN HIS MOTHER SAW HIM, SHE RAN AND HUGGED HIM AND
SAID : WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
DIDN’T I TELL  NOT TO BE LATE, AND COME BEFORE THE SUN SET ?

KEMO APOLOGIZED TO HIS MOM AND FAMILY AND PROMISED THEM
NOT TO GO TO THE FOREST BY HIMSELF AND  COME BACK HOME LATE EVER.
